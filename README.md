# Memory Game
### Third project in the Front End Web Development Nanodegree

This game's purpose is that all 8 pairs of cards are to be matched by clicking on each card and pairing it with the one with an identical symbol.

The game has a timer that counts the seconds and minutes from the first click on an unopened card until the game ends, a counter that takes into account all moves the player makes(every click on an unopened card), a star rating system that shows how well the player is doing and a modal that appears at the end of the game and shows how well the game was played by displaying the time it took, number of moves that were made and stars that remained.

### Instalation

To play the game, you can clone the git repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/GabrielaMacsim/Memory-Game-FEND.git
